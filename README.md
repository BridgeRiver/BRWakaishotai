# BRWakaishotai

An open-source Japanese handwriting font derived from Fontworks' Klee One. 

## Project Introduction

After Fontworks opened sourced the Klee One font, fonts such as Lxgw Wenkai GB(霞鹜文楷GB), Iansui(芫荽), and Jyunsaikaai(芫茜雅楷), which are close to standard handwritten fonts in various regions, gradually appeared on the Internet. The stroke design of Klee One itself is closer to the commonly used "educational script" style in Japanese teaching reference, but its character shape is closer to printed fonts. In order to enable Japanese language learners to better understand the standard handwritten Japanese fonts and provide Japanese users with a more suitable choice for handwritten fonts, so that the font can have a wider range of usage occasions, I have borrowed fonts such as LXGW Wenkai, LXGW Wenkai GB, Iansui, and YshiPen-Shuti, to modify Klee One to be as close as possible to the Japanese teaching reference standard fonts for Japanese language teaching and other purposes. Due to the main purpose of this font being for typesetting Japanese or displaying the written forms of Japanese teaching reference characters, it is named "Wakai(和楷)" after the character "wa(和)" representing the main ethnic group of Japan.

Considering that this font may be used as a display font for mobile phones and may need to be mixed with Simplified Chinese, I have completed the character count of the General Standard Chinese Character Table(通用规范汉字表) for this font using LXGW Wenkai and LXGW Wenkai GB based on the character count of Klee One. I have also adjusted these character shapes, such as following real or hypothetical Japanese standards, to ensure a unified style during mixing. In the later stage, I will merge characters such as LXGW Wenkai GB to continue expanding the number of characters, but there is currently no plan to adjust all the characters.
